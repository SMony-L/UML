In this assignment I have created my own main page for GUI I class as "index.html". I have dived the main page into a few contents. There are picture, navigation bar, page title and header. 

I created a menu bar with a dropdown bar for all the assignments in this class. All the drop down contents (Assignments) should link to all the homework that assigned for us. 

Home button has a hyperlink to the main page

About button has a hyperlink to another HTML file called "about.html" which will describe about the author. 

GUI_I also has a hyperlink to the main page of the professor.

I have applied some of my css skills and also got some of it from ONLINE.
